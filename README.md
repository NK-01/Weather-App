This is a screenshot of the Weather App in action. As you can see, the app displays the current weather conditions for the user's searched location, as well as a six-day forecast. The user can also search for the weather conditions in other locations using the search bar at the top.

## Description
This is a simple weather app that allows users to get real-time weather updates for any location in the world. The app is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and it fetches data from the OpenWeather API.

## Features
- Users can search for any location in the world and get real-time weather updates.
- The app displays current temperature, weather conditions, wind speed, humidity, pressure and real feel.
- Users can toggle between Celsius and Fahrenheit units.
- The app displays a six day forecast as well.

## Usage
To use the app, simply enter a location in the search bar and press the enter key. The app will fetch real-time weather data for the location and display it on the screen.

You can toggle between Celsius and Fahrenheit units by selecting the options present beside the current temperature.

You will also need to obtain an API key from the OpenWeather website and replace the apiKey variable in the app.js file (under srcs folder) with your own API key.
